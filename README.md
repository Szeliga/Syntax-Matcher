Syntax Matcher for Sublime Text 2
========================================

This syntax highlighter was taken directly from the work done by
[Felipe Coury](https://github.com/fcoury) [in this gist](https://gist.github.com/1514352)
with some modifications to make Cucumber matching better and then turning
it into a Sublime Text package for all to use.
